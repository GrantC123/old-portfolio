                    <p class="text-gray-700">The component that you created on figma for the AAG component was so well thought out that I haven't had to detach the component once, which for such a complex component says a lot. You really thought of every solution another designer might need. The slots allow me to play around with different design ideas so I can find the right solution for our team while still creating a standardized template to work in!
